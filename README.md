#Thinkster.io: MEAN Stack Tutorial

This repository is the result of following [this] (https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial) tutorial on how to create a basic web application using the MongoDB, Express.js, Angularjs, and Node.js stack.

I have excluded the `node_modules` from the repository. If you are interested in downloading this repository, and running it so that you can play with it, you will need to make sure you have the right things installed, which includes (but may not be limited to) `node.js`, `mongodb`, and `cURL`. 

That's all! Have fun poking around.
